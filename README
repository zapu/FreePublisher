My plugin to Freenet.

Needs jdom which is bundled to final jar with plugin (this is required by Freenet).

One day, this will allow you to:
- Publish things to Freenet under so called "Identity"
- Change things you published, keeping history of changes.
- Subscribe to other people and see their changes.
and maybe:
- Fork other people's things and let them merge your changes.
